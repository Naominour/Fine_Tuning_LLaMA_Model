It is the most aggressive and dangerous form of skin cancer, with a high risk of spreading to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most commonly found on the face, neck, chest, back, and arms. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving the chances of survival and minimizing the risk of recurrence.\n","Q: what are the signs and symptoms of Melanoma?\n","A: Melanoma can manifest in various ways, and it is important to be aware of the warning signs to catch it early.
